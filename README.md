# htmltotext-benchmark

The goal of this repository is to provide a dataset of html-to-text extractions performed by hand across as many languages as possible. 

To contribute, please download the html file to `<iso language code>/html/<any unique file name>.html` and put your resulting text in `<iso language code>/text/<any unique file name>.txt`. You can use any naming scheme you want (sequential ids, uuids, sha1sums, etc as long as the html and txt have the **same** name. 

There is no canonical workflow for downloading/labelling right now, but if you figure one out please make a pull request with the relevant scripts/tools!
